Aase-Remedios et al. (2023) MBE doi:

This dataset contains 5 file types:

1. Fasta formatted coding sequences for each of the NK gene families.
2. Fasta formatted amino acid alignments for each of the NK gene families.
3. Fasta formatted trimmed coding sequence alignments for each of the NK gene families.
4. Newick formatted constraint tree files for each of the NK gene families.
5. aBSREL output files (.json) for each of the NK gene families to visualise at http://vision.hyphy.org/aBSREL.
